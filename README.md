- You can change the notification frequency by changing the value of the "Interval" setting in the settings.

## Building
### Requirements
- Windows 10. (Other platforms may and may not work. Never tested, so I don't know.)
- Python 3.8 and above. I used Python 3.8.10 when developing and building this app.
- Pipenv tool (https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/)
- (For building installer) NSIS (https://nsis.sourceforge.io/). Make sure to put makensis in your PATH.
### Instructions
1. Rebuild the Pyinstaller bootloader.
   This step is required to reduce this program false positive detection as a virus. (It's not a virus!ðŸ¤£)
   - Download the latest release of Pyinstaller archive [here](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/releases).
     Make sure it is the same version as the latest on PyPi.
   - Extract the archive.
   - Go to UnpackedFolder/bootloader and execute this command ```python ./waf all```.
   - Go back to UnpackedFolder and create a wheel using extra commands based on your platform not using the generic bdist_wheel command.
     Check out the extra commands using ```python setup.py --help-commands```.
   - Edit the pyinstaller path on Pipfile to your generated wheel.
2. Set up the development environment.  
   > pipenv install --dev
3. Update SQLite
   Because Python 3.8 on Windows used older SQLite dll, it needs to be updated to the latest version.
   - Download the dll [here](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html).
   - After that, make a backup of the original sqlite3.dll in Python37/dll and replace it with the new version.
4. Start building!
   - For clean build:  
   > pipenv run build-onefile
   - For dirty build  (if you make small changes and want to quickly rebuild):  
   > pipenv run dirty-build-onefile
5. Finished build on dist folder.
6. Build the installer.
   - Make sure you on the root of the project and execute this command:
   > pipenv run generate-setup
